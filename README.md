## 🌍 Project Description
The platform provides an **interactive landing page** with engaging animations, a **solar potential calculator**, and informative sections that explain the benefits of renewable energy.

Users can enter details such as:
- Location or pin code  
- Energy consumption  
- Rooftop dimensions and type  
- Shading and sunlight conditions  

Based on this input, the system calculates:
- Estimated solar panel capacity (kW)
- Energy generated per day/month
- Cost savings compared to grid electricity
- Recommended installation size

The application focuses on **simplicity**, **accuracy**, and **visual appeal** to make solar understanding accessible to everyone.
